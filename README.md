This project explores the image of the child and family in children's plays of late Stalinism.<br /> <br />
The repository contains a corpus of Soviet post-war plays. These are plays awarded the Stalin Prize in the period from 1945 to 1953, as well as plays from the magazine "Theater" and "Pioneer Theater".
The repository also contains a script for calculating TF-IDF and a file with words with a high TF-IDF indicator for each document from the corpus. The plays in the corpus are organized thematically and divided into 10 groups, such as: <br />1) children's plays;<br />2) plays about factory;<br />3) plays about the collective farm;<br />4) plays about war;<br />5) plays about the great past of the Soviet Union;<br />6) historical plays about the formation of communism;<br />7) patriotic plays about Soviet scientists;<br />8) plays about intelligentsia lagging behind the spirit of the times;<br />9) plays about "decaying" life in the West;<br />10) prohibited plays, recognized by the authorities as “unprincipled.”<br /><br />
The project is a part of Ekaterina Kolevatova’s PhD dissertation “The Path of the Soviet Family from Late Stalinism to the Thaw”, which is being written as part of the “Family.Matters” project at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München.
